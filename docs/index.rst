   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to yawd-elfinder's documentation!
=========================================

`elFinder`_ is a jQuery file manager providing standard features -such as 
uploading, moving, renaming files etc-, as well as a set of advanced features
such as image resizing/cropping/rotation and archive file creation.

**yawd-elfinder** provides a fully-featured python/django implementation for the 
elfinder connector v.2. A custom Model Field (tied to a nice form widget) 
is also provided. Therefore, you can easily manage your files 
through the Django admin interface, assign them to model fields and access
the file URLs in your Django templates.
